# Maze
To play a maze game and win a prize!

Can be played using Oculus Quest 2. Use the Left controller to teleport to different areas on the Map. Find the key to unlock the correct door, using your right hand, to reach your final destination!

SNAPS was the Asset of choice for choosing all the props in the game. An office aesthetic was decided upon for the layout of the game. Reusing all the details taught in the course, such as the teleportation stations, mapping, Probuilds, ProGrid etc... the layout was extended upon from the coursework to emulate a very basic game. Some fixes need to be done in terms of the Door interacting with the left hand controller and the win text message needs to be triggered needs to be enabled only when player enters the area
